# THE SUCK INDEX: HOW MUCH WILL YOUR BIKE RIDE SUCK TODAY?

## Calculations
The Suck Index is based on the very subjective assumption that each increment of the following is roughly equivalent in terms of suckiness, and equal to one SuckPoint:
    - 2.5 degrees Celcius outside of ideal range
    - 20% cloud cover
    - 5km/hour headwind
    - 20mm of rain

Humidity acts as a multiplier when it's hot.


## But what does my score mean?
The following scale interprets the composite score:

    Below 5: Wow, what a day!!!!
    5-10: Things are fine.
    10-15: Things are not fine.
    15-20: It could get worse?
    Above 20: It could not POSSIBLY get any worse than this.
